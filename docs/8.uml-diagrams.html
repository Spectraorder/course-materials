# Overview

Primitive, standardized, easy-to-draw diagrams to quickly communicate software *structure* and *behavior*.

# Overview
## Types of diagrams

UML (Unified Modeling Language) provides for many types of diagrams, divided into two categories:

| Structural               | Behavioral              |
|: ----------------------- |: -----------------------|
| Class diagrams           | Activity diagrams       |
| Package diagrams         | Sequence diagrams       |
| Object diagrams          | Use case diagrams       |
| Component diagrams       | State diagrams          |
| Deployment diagrams      | Communication diagrams  |
|                          | Interaction diagrams    |
|                          | Timing diagrams         |

# Overview
## Types of diagrams

We will explore just a few diagram types for example.  

The book, "[The Elements of UML Style](http://bit.ly/se-elements-of-uml-style)", by Scott W. Ambler is a good reference for more - we have pulled many insights from it here.

# Best Practices

---

# Best Practices
Regardless of which diagram type, following best practices keeps diagrams understandable and avoids common pitfalls.
- Avoid crossed lines
- Avoid diagonal and curved lines
- Use consistent sizes
- Flow from top-to-bottom, left-to-right

---

# Best Practices
## Avoid crossed lines

Don't do this:

class: center, middle
name: classes

# Classes

---

# Classes
Used to display the attributes, methods, and interactions of object-oriented classes in code.

---

# Classes

A single class:

![UML class diagram](../images/uml_class_diagram.png)

---

# Classes

Relationships among classes:

![UML class diagram](../images/uml_class_diagram_relationship.png)

---

class: center, middle
name: use-cases

# Use Cases

---

# Use Cases

Used to indicate interactions between actors and the system.

---

# Use Cases
A single actor, a single system:
![UML use case diagram](../images/uml_use_case_diagram.png)

---

# Use Cases
Multiple actors, multiple releases:

![UML use case diagram](../images/uml_use_case_diagram_complex.png)

---

class: center, middle
name: activities

# Activities

---

# Activities

Flow charts often used to document a complex operation, the logic of one or more use cases, or any other process.

---

# Activities

![UML activity diagram](../images/uml_activity_diagram.png)

---

class: center, middle
name: sequences

# Sequences

---

# Sequences

Used to validate and work out the logic and completeness of a certain scenario, often a use case or a part of a use case.  

These show the entire sequence of messages sent among the objects and systems involved in the scenario.

---

# Sequences

![UML sequence diagram](../images/uml_sequence_diagram.png)

---

class: center, middle
name: state-charts

# State Charts

---

# State Charts

Indicate the dynamic behavior of an entity based on its response to events, showing how the entity reacts to various events based on its current state.
- Only useful when behavior changes significantly based on internal state of the object.
