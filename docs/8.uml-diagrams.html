# Overview
## Types of diagrams

UML (Unified Modeling Language) provides for many types of diagrams:

|: Structural              |: Behavioral             |
| ------------------------ |-------------------------|
| Class diagrams           | Activity diagrams       |
| Package diagrams         | Sequence diagrams       |
| Object diagrams          | Use case diagrams       |
| Component diagrams       | State diagrams          |
| Deployment diagrams      | Communication diagrams  |
|                          | Interaction diagrams    |
|                          | Timing diagrams         |

# Overview
## Types of diagrams

We will explore just a few diagram types for example.  

The book, "The Elements of UML Style", by Scott W. Ambler is a good reference for more.

# Best Practices

Regardless of which diagram type, following best practices keeps diagrams understandable and avoids common pitfalls.

---

# Best Practices
## Avoid crossed lines.
If you must cross lines, jump one over the other.

Don't do this:
![crossed lines](../images/uml_lines_cross_no_jump.png)

Do this:
![crossed lines](../images/uml_lines_cross_jump.png)

---

# Best Practices
## Avoid diagonal and curved lines.
Use straight lines only.

Don't do this:
![crossed lines](../images/uml_lines_cross_jump_diagonal.png)

Do this:
![crossed lines](../images/uml_lines_cross_jump_orthogonal.png)

---

# Best Practices
## Use consistent sizes
Separate instances of the same entity should the same size.

Don't do this:
![crossed lines](../images/uml_sizes_inconsistent.png)

Do this:
![crossed lines](../images/uml_sizes_consistent.png)

---

# Best Practices
## Flow top-to-bottom, left-to-right
The diagram should flow in the same direction as reading text.

Don't do this:
![crossed lines](../images/uml_flow_right_to_left.png)

Do this:
![crossed lines](../images/uml_flow_left_to_right.png)
