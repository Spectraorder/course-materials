# Overview

## Concept

A container is a small, standardized, portable, self-contained virtual environment within which application code can run.

Containers represent a major evolutionary step in the history of system virtualization.

# A Brief History of Virtualization

---

## Bare Metal Machines
In old times, a server was a physical device affectionately called a "box" or a "machine".  

These boxes, like your personal computers, typically had one set of hardware, an operating system, and some applications installed on it.

---

## Blade Servers
Computer hardware, loaded with the operating system and applications, was eventually fit onto a single hardware card.

Many such cards are slotted into a single "box", reducing space and sharing a single power supply for multiple machines.

## Virtual Machines
With increases in computing power, an entire machine - hardware and software included - could be virtualized, allowing one physical machine to run many simulated virtual machines.

Virtual machines have protections against one consuming the resources of another.

---

## Containers
Containers are a refinement of the concept of a virtual machine.

Containers only include the bare minimum environment setup necessary for the application they have hosted within them to run.

# Containers in Detail

---

## Players
Docker is the leader in the container field.  However, it is still an open competitive new field:
- Docker
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)
- Google [Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
- CoreOS [rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt/)
- Red Hat [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)
- Amazon's AWS supports containers
- Microsoft Azure supports containers
- IBM Cloud supports containers

---

## Image
A container's configuration is specified in its "image"
- images are the stuff from which containers are made
- i.e. containers are instances of an image
- creating a container is achieved by designing an image and instantiating it
- a single image can be instantiated into many containers, which can then be run across many different machines, if desired

---

## Registry
Registries :
- a central server that hosts images
- allow sharing of those images with teammates and/or the public
- essentially the same concept as repositories in version control

Examples:
- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and [Docker Store](https://store.docker.com/)

---

## Security

Containers do not run in total isolation from one-another.  This currently makes containers a bit less secure than more isolated environments.

However, containers can improve the reliability of testing, since since testing, development, and deployment environments are all set up the same way - as reproducible, portable containers.
- [Many traditional operations experts have concerns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PivpCKEiQOQ)

---

## Automation

Containers can be integrated with automation tools, such as Travis CI or Jenkins or via settings within container registries such as Docker Hub.
- every time a build or some other automation is complete, a container containing all security tests can be run
- see more on [linking GitHub to Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/link-source/) for [automated builds on commit](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/#link-to-a-hosted-repository-service)
