## Concept

A container is a standardized, highly portable, self-contained virtual environment within which application code can run.

Containers represent a major evolutionary step in the history of system virtualization.

# A Brief History of Virtualization

---

## Bare Metal Machines
In old times, a server was a physical device affectionately called a "box" or a "machine".  

These boxes, like your personal computers, typically had one set of hardware, an operating system, and some applications installed on it.

## Blade Servers
Computer hardware, loaded with the operating system and applications, was eventually fit onto a single hardware card.

Many such cards are slotted into a single "box", reducing space and sharing a single power supply for multiple machines.

## Virtual Machines
With increases in computing power, an entire machine - hardware and software included - could be virtualized, allowing one physical machine to run many simulated virtual machines.

Virtual machines have protections against one consuming the resources of another.

## Containers
Containers are a refinement of the concept of a virtual machine.
