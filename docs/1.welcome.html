# Attempts at a definition
## IEEE

> The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software.

# Attempts at a definition
## ACM

> Software engineering is concerned with developing and maintaining software systems that behave reliably and efficiently, are affordable to develop and maintain, and satisfy all the requirements that customers have defined for them.

# Confusion by job title
## Useless

Job titles vary wildly in industry.  For example, each of these titles may or may not be for the role and responsibilities of a software engineeer - there is no way to know.
- Software engineer
- Software developer
- Software architect
- IT consultant
- IT specialist
- Systems analyst
- Developer
- Coder
- Programmer
- Ninja
- Requirements engineer
- Testing engineer
- Q/A engineer
... and many more

# Definition by antithesis
## The Software Crisis

The origins of software engineering as a discipline lend it to be best defined by what it is not.

In particular, software engineering originated during the turbulent times of the 1960's, when people began to realize it was a rare project which resulted in efficient and well-functioning software in a reasonable amount of time at a reasonable cost.

This became known as the great Software Crisis!

## The Software Crisis

> By the time [the art of programming] reached 25, the difficulties of building big software loomed so large that in the autumn of 1968 the NATO Science Committee convened some 50 top programmers, computer scientists and captains of industry to plot a course out of what had come to be known as the software crisis. Although the experts could not contrive a road map to guide the industry toward firmer ground, they did coin a name for that distant goal: software engineering, now defined formally as “the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software.”
> 
> A quarter of a century later software engineering remains a term of aspiration.

# Definition by antithesis
## Bespoke development

Today, the antagonist to our protagonist is the **bespoke** developer - an individual or team who work take a unique custom-tailored approach to every project, producing beautiful works of art perectly fitted to the customer (or to themselves).

Software engineers, in contrast, streamline development such that the work references genericized norms, best-practices, standards, and patterns known to many developers and shared by many projects in the field.

In other words, software engineers are the fry cooks of the industrial software development assembly line.

# Definition by antithesis
## Bespoke development

The ideal of artisanal work is much pined for for its uniqueness and attention to detail.

But artisanal approaches do not scale well because...
- software is increasingly complex.
- demand for software is everywhere and increasing.
- artisanal approaches are, by nature, time consuming and expensive.

# Challenges
## Software is increasingly complex

> Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.
>
> - [Fred Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law), from "The Mythical Man-Month"

Creating quality software is hard, especially on a large scale
- Developer onboarding
- System complexity
- Client expectations

---

# Challenges
## Demand for software is increasing

From the [Bureau of Labor Statistics summary of Software Developer jobs](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm):
- 2018 Median Pay: $105,590 per year / $50.77 per hour
- Typical Entry-Level Education: Bachelor's degree
- Work Experience in a Related Occupation: None
- Work Experience in a Related Occupation: None
- On-the-job Training: None
- Number of Jobs, 2018: 1,365,500
- Job Outlook, 2018-28: 21% (Much faster than average)
- Employment Change, 2018-28: 284,100

# Challenges
## Software must ideally be delivered on-time on-budget

Engineering is the application of science and knowledge to practical applications. Software engineering aims to produce real-world software that can be used by its customers to solve their problems.

There is almost universally a budget and a deadline.  Engineers must figure out how to solve the problem with those constraints.

# Intrusion of DevOps
## Merging Development with Operations

DevOps is the fusion of...
- Development (writing code) 
- Operations (IT tools and infrastructure)

Formerly considered disparate disciplines, in contemporary thought, operations functions are either incorporated into the workload of developers, or managed by IT specialists working in close communication with developers.

---

# Intrusion of DevOps
## Relying on automation

How Operations can be merged with Development is largely explained by the rise of automation.

Automated tools and virtualization now allow developers to trigger formerly time- and resource-consuming IT operations with minimal setup and wait time and minimal reliance on humans.

Operations such as the following are now often done with the assistance of automated tools:
- setting development and production environments
- monitoring progress
- testing
- deploying
- securing applications
