# Attempts at a definition

# Attempts at a definition
## Wikipedia

> Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method. 
> --- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering)

---

# Attempts at a definition
## IEEE

> The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software; that is, the application of engineering to software. 
> --- IEEE Standard 610.12

---

# Attempts at a definition
## ACM

> Software engineering is concerned with developing and maintaining software systems that behave reliably and efficiently, are affordable to develop and maintain, and satisfy all the requirements that customers have defined for them.
> --- ACM

# Attempts at a definition
## Merriam-Webster

> A branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, and maintenance of complex computer programs.

# Attempts at a definition
## Foo Barstein

> Software engineerings is the systematic approach to creating software that uses empirical, evidence-based social and practical knowledge to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve software.

# Definition by job title

# Definition by job title
## A terrible idea

Job titles vary wildly in industry.  For example, each of these titles may or may not be for a software engineering position - there is no way to know:
- Software engineer
- Software developer
- Software architect
- IT consultant
- IT specialist
- Systems analyst
- Developer
- Coder
- Programmer
- Ninja
- Requirements engineer
- Testing engineer
- Q/A engineer
... and many more

# Definition by contrast

# Definition by contrast
## Works out pretty well.

The origins of software engineering as a discipline lend it to be defined by what it is not.

In particular, software engineering can be defined as the opposite of the bespoke approach.

But let's step back in time a bit...

# The software crisis

# The software crisis
## Our creation myth

Software engineering is a reaction to the software crisis.

> The art of programming has taken 50 years of continual refinement to reach this stage. By the time it reached 25, the difficulties of building big software loomed so large that in the autumn of 1968 the NATO Science Committee convened some 50 top programmers, computer scientists and captains of industry to plot a course out of what had come to be known as the software crisis. Although the experts could not contrive a road map to guide the industry toward firmer ground, they did coin a name for that distant goal: software engineering, now defined formally as “the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation and maintenance of software.”
> 
> A quarter of a century later software engineering remains a term of aspiration.

# The bespoke approach

---

# The bespoke approach
## Artisanally-crafted, fresh-brewed, hand-made, one-of-a-kind

The antagonist to our protagonist is the bespoke developer - an individual or team who work in an idiosyncratic style, taking a unique custom-tailored approach to every project, sometimes producing beautiful works of art.

Software engineers, in contrast, attempt to streamline development such that the work references known norms, best-practices, standards, and patterns shared by many in the field. 

In other words, we are the line cooks of the industrial software assembly line.

# The bespoke approach
## What's wrong with tailored suits?

The ideal of artisanal work is much pined for.  But...
- Artisanal approaches do not scale well.
- Software is increasingly complicated.
- Software is everywhere, artisans are in short supply

# Conclusions
Thank you. Bye.
