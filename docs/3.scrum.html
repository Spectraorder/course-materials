# Agile manifesto

---

template: manifesto
name: manifesto-1

In 2001, at The Lodge at the Snowbird Ski Resort in Utah, 17 developers got together to talk shop.  

They emerged shortly thereafter with the Agile Manifesto.

---

template: manifesto
name: manifesto-2

> We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.
> 
> Through this work we have come to value:
> * *Individuals and interactions* over processes and tools
> * *Working software* over comprehensive documentation
> * *Customer collaboration* over contract negotiation
> * *Responding to change* over following a plan
> 
> That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
>

The Agile manifesto inspired a world of developers, but there were no details on how to implement it.

Various practical implementation frameworks quickly emerged.

[Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum/) is one of these.

# Scrum framework

---

template: scrum
name: scrum-1

The Scrum framework is a recipe for achieving agile development by prescribing a strict set of...
- Roles
- Events
- Artifacts

---

name: roles

# Roles

---

template: roles
name: roles-1

Scrum defines four distinct roles:
- Product owner
- Scrum master
- Developer
- Stakeholder

---

template: roles-1
name: roles-2

It is possible, although not adviseable, for one person to perform more than one of these roles.

---

template: roles
name: roles-3

## Product owner

The Product Owner represents the business interests within the team.

---

template: roles-3
name: roles-4

The Product Owner is the team member who communicates directly with the client.

---

template: roles-4
name: roles-5

The Product Owner is the team member who maintains and prioritizes the list of features to be implemented.

---

template: roles
name: roles-6

## Scrum master

The Scrum Master represents the Scrum framework within the team.

---

template: roles-6
name: roles-7

The Scrum Master is a "servant leader", not a manager.

---

template: roles-7
name: roles-8

The Scrum Master ensures the team is following the Scrum framework.

---

template: roles
name: roles-9

## Developer

Developers implement the work laid out by the Product Owner.

---

template: roles-9
name: roles-10

Developers collaborate with the Product Owner to properly define and scope the work.

---

template: roles-10
name: roles-11

Developers are autonomous and decide in what manner to do the work.

---

template: roles
name: roles-12

## Stakeholder

Stakeholders are people external to the team who have an important voice.

---

template: roles-12
name: roles-13

Stakeholders could be the client, or executives in the development company.

---

template: roles-13
name: roles-14

Stakeholders can cause problems if not kept in close communication with the team.

template: events
name: events-1

Scrum defines seven ritual events for different purposes:
- Backlog creation
- Sprint planning
- Daily scrum
- Backlog grooming
- Sprint review
- Stakeholder demo
- Team retrospective

## Backlog creation

The Product Backlog is a list of features that the project is intended to implement.  These featuress are written in a specific style and called "User Stories".

---

template: events-2
name: events-3

The Product Owner, by speaking with Stakeholders, drafts and maintains the Product Backlog at the start of a project.

---

template: events-3
name: events-4

The features in the Product Backlog are ordered, with the most important User Stories on top of the list.

---

template: events
name: events-5

## Backlog creation
### User stories

User Stories are written in the following form:
> As a _______, I want to _______, so that _______

- the first blank is filled in with a user role or type of user
- the second blank is filled in with a goal
- the third blank is filled in with a reason

These are written in non-technical language by the Product Owner.

## Backlog creation
### User stories

User Stories should follow the *INVEST* acronym:
- **I**ndependent - user stories do not depend on one-another

---

template: events-6
name: events-7

- **N**egotiable - can be canceled or changed at any time

---

template: events-7
name: events-8

- **V**aluable - meaningful stories

---

template: events-8
name: events-9

- **E**stimable - must be descriptive and small enough to be able to easily estimate work for it.

---

template: events-9
name: events-10

- **S**mall - story is small enough to be completed in one sprint

---

template: events-10
name: events-11

- **T**estable - story contains enough clarity to be able to easily design a test for it

---

template: events
name: events-12

## Backlog creation
### User stories

User Stories each have a set of **Acceptance Criteria**.
- This represents the minimum requirements for the User Story to be considered done.
- The Product Owner and Developers collaborativeley come up with this list of requirements.

---

template: events
name: events-13

## Backlog creation
### User stories

User Stories each have an **Estimation of Effort** 
- The Developers determine how much work is involved in the user story.
- **Planning Poker** is a popular technique for determining this.

---

## Backlog creation
### Spikes

Sometimes work needs to be done that is not end-user-facing, such as setting up a particular development environment.  

Such a piece of work is called a *Spike*.

## Sprint planning

In Scrum, work is divided into increments called "sprints".  Sprints typically last several weeks.

---

template: sprint-planning-1
name: sprint-planning-2

- At the start of each Sprint, the entire team (including Product Owner) gets together and decides which features (i.e. User Stories) to work on in this Sprint.

---

template: sprint-planning-2
name: sprint-planning-3

- The Product Owner presents the list of User Stories in the Product Backlog, from top to bottom.

---

template: sprint-planning-3
name: sprint-planning-4

- The team discusses and collaboratively agrees on which User Stories to do in this Sprint.

---

template: sprint-planning-4
name: sprint-planning-5

- The Developers break up each User Story into discrete Tasks - units of work that are doable by one developer in about one day.

---

template: events
name: sprint-planning-6

## Sprint planning

The team discusses and collaboratively agrees on which User Stories to do in this Sprint.  These are added to the Sprint Backlog.

---

template: sprint-planning-6
name: sprint-planning-7

The Developers break up each User Story in the Sprint Backlog into discrete Tasks - units of work that are doable by one developer in about one day.

---

template: sprint-planning-7
name: sprint-planning-8

Each task is assigned to a specific developer.

---

template: sprint-planning-8
name: sprint-planning-9

The Developers get to work.

---

# Events
## Daily Scrum

Every day, the Scrum Master and Developers get together to discuss status.

Each Developer answers three questions:
- What did you do yesterday?
- What are you doing today?
- Is there anything blocking your progress?

Blocking problems are addressed by the Scrum Master, who seeks help externally.

---

# Events
## Backlog Grooming

Each Sprint, the Product Owner maintains the Product Backlog - adding new User Stories, modifying old ones, etc.

In the mid-point of each Sprint, the entire team  (including Product Owner) gets together to discuss these additions.

The team discusses the new User Stories, and the Product Manager orders them appropriately in the Product Backlog.

No User Stories are ever added to the current Sprint, but they can be addressed in subsequent Sprints.

---

# Events
## Sprint review

At the end of each Sprint, the entire team (including Product Owner) meet to discuss the work that has been done.

Unfinished User Stories are returned to the Product Backlog.

The team agrees what is good enough to show to the Stakeholders.

---

# Events
## Stakeholder demo

The entire team demonstrates the work to the Stakeholders.

The Product Owner often leads the demo, althogh may do so, if helpful.

Stakeholders give feedback, suggest additions, changes, etc.  

The Product Owner adds any new User Stories requested by the Stakeholders to the Product Backlog.

---

# Events
## Team retrospective

The team discusses what happened in this sprint.
- How did the demo go?
- What worked well?
- What went poorly?
- How can we improve next time?

# Communications

It is expected in Scrum that team members and Stakeholers always know the status of work currently being done.

The primary document outlining the status of thee project is the Task Board.

---

# Communications
## Task Board

The Task board divides the activities in the current Sprint into the following categories:
- Sprint Backlog -  list of all the User Stories that are being worked on this Sprint.
- To Do - a list of all the Tasks that have not yet been started,
- In Process - a list of the Tasks that are currently in-progress.
- Awaiting Review - a list of the Tasks that are Awaiting review by another team member.
- Done - a list of the Tasks that have been reviewed and are considered complete.

The Task Board must be kept up-to-date at all times by the Product Owner and Developers.

# Team harmony

It is critical that all team members be able to see the accurate status of all Tasks by all Developers.

It is a good idea to draft a set of Team Norms that govern team member behavior.

It is a good idea to inform the boss early if any team member is not performing their duties.
