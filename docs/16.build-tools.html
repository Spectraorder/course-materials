# Overview

---

## Concept

System building is the process of creating complete, executable system by compiling and linking the system components, external libraries, configuration files, and other information. 

---

## Challenge

System building must take into account many complex environmental and programmatic factors, and steps must often be performed in a particular sequence in order for the build to succeed. 

---

## Solution

Automated build tools are generally necessary to handle the complexity.

# Common Features of Build Tools

---

## Build Script Generation

The build system should analyze the program that is being built, identify dependent components, and automatically generate a build script (configuration file). 

The system should also support the manual creation and editing of these build scripts.

---

## Version Control Integration

The build system should be able to check out the required versions of components from a version control system.

---

## Minimal Recompilation

The build system should work out what source code needs to be recompiled and set up compilations as necessary.

---

## Executable System Creation

The build system should link the compiled object code files with each other and with other required files, such as libraries and configuration files, to create an executable system

---

## Test Automation

Build systems should be able to integrate with test automation tools such as xUnit other similar unit testing tools which check that the build has not been "broken" by the changes.

---

## Reporting

The build system should provide reports about the success or failure of the build and the tests that have been run.

---

## Documentation Generation

The build system may be able to generate release notes about the build and system help pages automatically.

# Stages

---

## Developer's Machine

Developers may wish to test and build locally before performing the 'official' build. 

They will typically check out the latest version from the version control system and try to build it locally.

The developer's machine often differs significantly from the target machine that code will be deployed to.

---

## Build Server

Used to build the definitive version of the system. 

Should integrate with the version control system to build the latest.

---

## Target Machine 

The platform on which the system is ultimately intended to execute. This may be significantly different from the development machines and build servers. 

Keeping the developer's machines and the build server environment in close emulation of the Target Environment is a whole 'nother area of automation.

In cases where the target machines differ significantly from the others, testing cannot be complete until done on a target machine.

# Continuous Integration

---

## Automated Build and Test

Agile methodology promotes the practice of very frequent automated builds and automated testing once the build is done - such automated or semi-automated processes in the software engineering lifecycle are collectively known as **continuous integration** (CI).

**Jenkins** and **Travis CI** are two popular tools for performing Continuous Integration - there are many others as well.

# Popular Build Tools

---

## Make

Make, included in UNIX starting in 1976, and the many automation tools derived from the original make, is considered a classic build automation tool. 

It was created to solve the all-too-common problem of developers wasting time debugging builds where the problem was human error in performing the build, not software bugs in the code.

Key features:
- used primarily for C and C++ development, but can be used as generaal purpose automation tool
- build script written in an idiosyncratic script file named `Makefile`
- allows multiple build targets
- tracks dependencies
- performs minimal recompilation

---

## Ant

Apache Ant, begun in 2000, is a popular automated build tool that was designed explicitly to address some of the shortcomings of Make for Java builds.

Key features:
- open source
- build scripts written in XML in a file named `build.xml`
- supports same basic functionality as Make, but...
- is platform-agnostic, unlike Make
- contains a built-in recognition of common steps in building Java projects, unlike Make
- integrates with unit testing frameworks, such as JUnit

---

## Maven

Apache Maven is a successor to Apache Ant, initially released in 2004, that aims to address some of Ant's shortcomings, plus adding some additional features. 

Key features:
- open source
- build scripts written in XML in a file named `pom.xml`
- supports same basic functionality as Ant, but...
- unlike Ant, Maven takes a "**convention over configuration**" approach
- supports multiple languages, not just Java (although in reality it is mostly used for Java)
- plug-in architecture allows 3rd-party tools to be integrated into Maven builds
- maintains a repository of plug-ins for easy discovery and installation

---

## Gradle

Gradle is [yet another] open source build automation tool primarily focused on Java projects. 

Key features:
- open source
- build scripts written in Groovy in a file named `build.gradle`
- supports same basic functionality as Maven, but...
- easier to customize a build than in Maven

---

## Grunt

Grunt is a Javascript-specific build automation tool, started in 2012, that can be setup to automate repetitive build-related tasks like minification of code, compilation, unit testing, code linting, etc.

Key features:
- open source
- build scripts written in Javascript in a file named `Gruntfile`
- attempts to bring the joy of Ant/Maven/Gradle-style automated builds specifically into the world of Javascript projects.

---

## NPM

In many ways, Node Package Manager (NPM) itself can be considered a build tool.

NPM includes:
- tracking dependencies (in the package.json file)
- automated builds (by running `npm install`)
- integration with unit testing (by adding a `test` script to package.json)
- allows any arbitrary script to be run (by adding scripts to package.json)
