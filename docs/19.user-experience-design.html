# Overview

---

## Concept
User Experience Design (UX), sometimes called Customer Experience Design (CX) or Interaction Design (IxD), is the design of products and services in a way that achieves business goals while also meeting the needs, goals, and abilities of end-users.

---

## Cross-Discipline
User Experience Design (UX) often requires a mixture of cross-discipline skills:
- **Technological** - e.g. comprehending what designs are technically feasible
- **Business** - e.g. internalizing the business goals at the core of all designs
- **Psychological** - e.g. predicting people's behavioral tendencies in particular contexts
- **Social** - e.g. bridging the gap between business and product development
- **Aesthetical** - e.g. abiding by conventions and norms in visual and interaction designs

---

## Difference
User Experience Design (UX) is not a replacement for...
- **Visual Design** - e.g. the perfect static design of all interface components like images, buttons, icons and other components.
- **User Interface Design** - e.g. the perfect static design of all screens an end-user will see
- **Development** - e.g. writing code
- **Business Strategy** - e.g. identifying an organization's core business goals and how to approach them
- **Market Research** - e.g. identifying competitors in the market and the behaviors and attributes of target end-users/customers

# Discovery

---

## Concept
Similar to software development as a whole, User Experience Design work often begins with the **discovery** of at least:
- the organization's business goals
- any technical constraints
- end-user's needs and desires

---

## Method
As with **requirements gathering** more generally, User Experience Design discovery could involve:
- review of an existing iteration of a given product or service
- review of any internal documenation of the product or service
- review of any analytics of the performance or success of the product or service
- stakeholder interviews
- end-user interviews and observation
- review of any market research or psychological studies about the target demographic(s)
- review of competitors' offerings

---

## Artefacts
As a result of the discovery process, the following artefacts may be produced
- **discovery document** - documents what has been discovered at a high level
- **content strategy** - how to approach the problem of developing content for the target audience
- **personas** - imaginary stereotypes of the different types of end-users of concern
- **user scenarios** - a form of requirements sometimes misleadingly called "use cases" - these describe situations in which end-userss may find themselves and how the product or service meets their needs

# Design

---

## Concept
Design is the implementation of the plans and blueprints of the product or service **from a user's perspective**.

It is not the implementation of the product or service itself.

---

## Method
User Experience Design process involves drafting sufficient written documents, diagrams, and sometimes prototypes to show all parties how a product or service would function over time, from a user's perspective.

---

## Artefacts
The documents drafted might include:
- flow diagrams
- ecosystem maps
- user journey maps
- content audit / gap analysis
- site map / app map
- wireframe diagrams
- prototypes

# Reflection

---

## Concept
Reflection is the determination of success or failure.

Once the product or service has been launched, in order to understand whether it is a success or not, clear business goals must have been addressed at the beginning.

---

## Methodology
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- A/B Testing
- End-User interviews / observation
