# Overview

---

template: overview
name: concept

## Concept

`bash` is the most commonly used **shell** for Unix/Linux

---

template: concept
name: concept-1

- aimed to be a replacement for UNIX's proprietary Bourne shell, `sh`.

---

template: concept-1
name: concept-2

- 'bash' is an acronym for '**B**ourne-**A**gain **SH**ell'

---

template: concept-2
name: concept-3

- a 'shell' is a command line interpreter that allows users to interface with a computer operating system via text commands

---

template: concept-3
name: concept-4

- written by Brian Fox in 1989 at the behest of Richard Stallman, founder of the [GNU project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project) that created GNU, the **free software** clone of UNIX we now call Linux

template: overview
name: value

## Value

Of what use to us is a 30+-year old set of rudimentary operating system commands?

---

template: value
name: value-1

- knowledge of the command line is assumed of any software developer

---

template: value-1
name: value-2

- many common tasks are accomplished most quickly via simple shell commands

---

template: value-2
name: value-3

- some tasks simply cannot be performed any other way

---

template: value-3
name: value-4

- a shell script can automate away just about any repetitive task required of a developer

---

template: value-4
name: value-5

- automation is one of the main foci of the software engineer

---

template: overview
name: interfaces

## Interfaces

`bash` commands can be run in one of two ways:

---

template: interfaces
name: interfaces-1

- entered idiosyncratically into the **command line**

---

template: interfaces-1
name: interfaces-2

- saved as a script into a **file** (usually given the `.sh` extension) and executed as a batch

---

name: script-file-setup

# Script File Setup

---

template: script-file-setup
name: shebang

## Shebang

The very first two characters in a bash script file must be shebang `#!`

Follow this with the path name to bash, e.g. (your path may differ)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

---

template: shebang
name: shebang-1

You can also usually find the location of bash by referring to your machine's environment settings
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

---

template: shebang-1
name: shebang-2

Anytime a shebang is used, the kernel will pass the path to the script as the first argument to the script.  Yes, scripts can take arguments.

template: script-file-setup
name: file-permissions

## File Permissions

Give yourself execute permissions to run a script file directly:
```bash
chmod u+x file.sh
```

---

template: file-permissions
name: file-permissions-1

Now execute the script:
```bash
./file.sh
```

---

template: file-permissions-1
name: file-permissions-2

If you don't have execute permission, but do have read permission, you can still run the file:

```bash
bash file.sh
```

---

name: built-in-commands

# Built-In Commands

---

template: built-in-commands
name: show-commands

## All commands

Bash comes with a bunch of built-in commands.  To show a list of them all:
```bash
enable | cut -d' ' -f 2
```

---

template: built-in-commands
name: show-keywords

## All keywords

There are also a few reserved keywords you can review:
```bash
compgen -k
```

---

template: built-in-commands
name: path-variable

## PATH Variable

bash's PATH variable contains a list of directories where bash will, by default, look for executable programs and shell commands.

Display the contents of PATH:
```bash
echo $PATH
```

---

template: path-variable
name: path-variable-1

Add a directory to the PATH... directories must be separated by colons.
```bash
PATH=$PATH:/Users/foo/Downloads/spyware
```

---

template: built-in-commands
name: time-keeping

## Time-Keeping

The `time` command can be useful to determine how long a process take to complete.  It reports:

---

template: time-keeping
name: time-keeping-1

- **real time** - time the process took in regular human minutes / seconds

---

template: time-keeping-1
name: time-keeping-2

- **user time** - amount of time the CPU was used to execute the process

---

template: time-keeping-2
name: time-keeping-3

- **system time** - CPU time used by the kernel in order to run the process (i.e. running a process includes some additional kernel overhead)

---

template: time-keeping-3
name: time-keeping-4

Measure the time taken by the `ls -la` command:
```bash
time ls -la
```

template: built-in-commands
name: pipes

## Pipes

Pipes allow the output of one program to serve as input for another.

---

template: pipes
name: pipes-1

List only .txt files in the current working directory:
```bash
ls -l | grep "\.txt$"
```

---

template: pipes-1
name: pipes-2

Swap all vowels in a file listing with 'u'
```bash
ls -l | sed -e "s/[aeio]/u/g"
```

---

template: pipes-2
name: pipes-3

If you really want to be a devops guru, learn the `grep`, `sed`, and `awk` commands in detail - [here's a decent intro](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mijp1/teaching/2nd_year_Comp_Lab/guides/grep_awk_sed.pdf).

---

template: built-in-commands
name: output-redirection

## Output redirection

While the system default output is to print to the command line, it is possible to redirect any command's output to a file or other resource.

---

template: output-redirection
name: output-redirection-1

Output the list of files from the previous example to a file named `long_listing.txt`:
```bash
ls -l | grep "\.txt$" > long_listing.txt
```

---

template: output-redirection-1
name: output-redirection-2

Append the word, `flibbertigibbet` to the file named `will-o-the-whisp.txt`
```bash
echo "flibbertigibbet" >> will-o-the-whisp.txt
```

---

template: output-redirection-2
name: output-redirection-3

Hide any output by redirecting it to `/dev/null`:
```bash
echo "Help!!!" > /dev/null
```

---

template: built-in-commands
name: command-subs

## Command substitution

It is possible to use the output of any bash command as data within a bash script.

---

template: command-subs
name: command-subs-1

Place $() around the command whose output you wish to capture
```bash
# output the text, "Hello world" the hard way
RECIPIENT=$(echo world)
echo Hello $RECIPIENT!
```

# Programming controls

---

template: programming
name: variables

## Variables

Variable assignments must not have spaces around the = sign:
```bash
some_variable_name="this is a string"
```

---

template: variables
name: variables-1

Read value of a variable with a $ in front of variable name
```bash
echo the value of some_variable_name is $some_variable_name
```

---

template: programming
name: aliases

## Aliases

The `alias` command allow you to set other names for common commands.

```bash
alias ll="ls -l"
```

---

template: aliases
name: aliases-1

To execute a command alias, in this case to perform `ls -la`:
```bash
ll
```

---

template: aliases-1
name: aliases-2

See all aliases currently set in the shell session:
```bash
alias
```

---

template: programming
name: conditionals

## Conditionals

bash supports the usual if/else if/else controls, albeit with archaic syntax:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

T1="foo"
T2="bar"

if [ "$T1" == "$T2" ]; then
    echo expression evaluated as true
else
    echo expression evaluated as false, obviously
fi
```

---

template: programming
name: loops

## Loops

bash supports both `for` and `while` loops:

For:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

for i in {1..5}; do 
  echo $i
done
```

---

template: loops
name: loops-1

While:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

COUNTER=0

# note the archaic syntax for the less than operator
while [  $COUNTER -lt 10 ]; do
	echo The counter is $COUNTER
	let COUNTER=$COUNTER+1 
done
```

---

template: programming
name: loops-continued

## Loops (continued)
It is also possible to loop through lines of output from another command using command substitution:
```bash
for i in $( ls ); do
    echo ... $i ...
done
```

---

template: loops-continued
name: loops-continued-1

```bash
while IFS= read -r line; do
    echo "... $line ..."
done <<< $(ls)
```

[Try it!](https://repl.it/repls/MoccasinDeterminedAngle)

---

template: programming
name: functions

## Functions

A function with a local variable:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
HELLO=Hello 
function hello {
        local HELLO=World
        echo $HELLO
}
echo $HELLO
hello
echo $HELLO
```

---

template: functions
name: functions-1

A function with an argument:
```bash
#!/bin/bash 
function e {
    echo $1 
}  
e Hello
e World
```

---

template: programming
name: exports

## Exports

A copy of a variable defined within a script can be copied into your command-line environment, which makes it available to any other scripts you run
```bash
export some_variable_name
```

---

template: exports
name: exports-1

Functions can also be exported
```bash
export -f some_function_name
```

---

template: exports-1
name: exports-2

Print what has been exported to the command-line:
```bash
export
```

---

name: grouping

# Grouping

---

template: grouping
name: parentheses

## Parentheses

Commands grouped within parentheses are separate processes. Variables defined within the sub-process are not shared with the parent process.
```bash
a=1
(
a=2
)
echo $a
# prints 1
```

---

template: grouping
name: braces

## Braces

Commands grouped with braces do not spawn a sub-process, so variables therein are shared:
```bash
a=1
{
a=2
}
echo $a
# prints 2
```

---

name: automation

# Automation

---

template: automation
name: startup-scripts

## Startup Scripts

Bash is used for everyday automation by developers:

---

template: startup-scripts
name: startup-scripts-1

- Every time a user logs into a user logs in, a bash script named `.bash_profile` is automatically run.

---

template: startup-scripts-1
name: startup-scripts-2

- Every time a new command shell is started, a script named `.bashrc` is automatically run.

---

template: startup-scripts-2
name: startup-scripts-3

Place whatever bash commands you want in files by either of these names in your user account home directory in order to take advantage of this feature.

---

template: automation
name: aliases-file

## Aliases File

Many developers use bash aliases for common commands.

---

template: aliases-file
name: aliases-file-1

For good housekeeping, store many aliases, if you have them, in a `~/.bash_aliases` file and load them automatically in your `.bashrc` script every time a shell session starts.

---

template: aliases-file-1
name: aliases-file-2

Example `.bashrc` script to check whether such an aliases file exists and execute it, if so:
```bash
if [ -f ~/.bash_aliases ]; then
. ~/.bash_aliases
fi
```

---

template: automation
name: software-dev-automation

## Software Development Automation

Agile Software Developers depend upon automation to simplify and speed up many pedestrian tasks.  

---

template: software-dev-automation
name: software-dev-automation-1

For example, in **continuous integration**, unit tests that automatically validate that the code behaves as expected are automatically executed anytime the codebase in version control is modified.

---

template: software-dev-automation-1
name: software-dev-automation-2

Similarly, in a practice known as **continuous deployment**, copy files from a version control repository to a live server allow software to be made available to its end-users as soon as changes are committed. 

---

template: automation
name: software-dev-automation-3

## Jenkins example

A fragment of such a script that could be used in **Jenkins**, a popular automation tool to execute some follow-up actions anytime a change is committed to particular branches of a version control repository:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

if [[ $BRANCH_NAME == "master" ]] || [[ $BRANCH_NAME == "master_dev" ]]
then
    ./runUnitTests.sh $REPOSITORY_NAME $BASE_BUILD_CORE $BRANCH_NAME $BUILD_NUMBER || echo "The npm may fail but the report exists"
fi
```

Jenkins sets up variables named `BRANCH_NAME`, `REPOSITORY_NAME`, etc and this code uses those to decide what to do.

---

template: automation
name: software-dev-automation-4

## Travis CI example

**Travis CI**, another popular automation tool, can also run a bash script when any codebase changes 
```yaml
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: bash scripts/deploy.sh
  on:
    branch: master
```

In this case, we see the contents of a file named `.travis.yml` that would be placed in the version control repository.  This settings file informs Travis to execute a script named `deploy.sh` anytime new code is pushed to the `master` branch.
