# Overview

---

## Concept

bash is the most commonly used shell for Unix/Linux
- written by Brian Fox at the behest of Richard Stallman and the GNU project.
- aimed to be a replacement for UNIX's Bourne shell
- 'bash' is an acronym for 'Bourne-Again SHell'

---

## Interfaces

bash commands can be run in one of two ways:
- entered idiosyncratically into the command line
- saved into a file (usually given the .sh extension) and executed as a batch

# Script File Setup

---

## Shebang

The very first two characters in a bash script file must be shebang '#!'

Follow this with the path name to bash, e.g. (your path may differ)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

You can also automatically find the location of bash within the environment settings
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
```

Anytime shebang is used, the kernel will pass the path to the script as the first argument to the script

---

## File Permissions

Give the script execute Permissions:
```bash
chmod u+x file.sh
```

Execute the script:
```bash
./file.sh
```

If you don't have execute permission, but do have read permission, you can still run the file:

```bash
bash file.sh
```

# Built-In Commands

---

## Show Built-In Commands

Show a list of all built-in commands in the language:
```bash
enable
```

Get a list of reserved keywords in bash:
```bash
compgen -k
```

---

## PATH Variable

bash's PATH variable contains a list of directories where bash will, by default, look for executable programs.

Display the contents of PATH:
```bash
echo $PATH
```

Add a directory to the PATH
```bash
PATH=$PATH:/Users/foo/Downloads/spyware
```

---

## Time-Keeping

The `time` command can help determine how long processes take to execute.  It reports:
- **real time** - time the process took in minutes / seconds
- **user time** - CPU time used to execute the process
- **system time** - CPU time used by the kernel in order to run the process (i.e. running a process includes some kernel overhead)

Measure the time taken by the `ls -la` command:
```bash
time ls -la
```

---

## Pipes

Pipes allow the output of one program to serve as input for another

List only .txt files in the current working directory:
```bash
ls -l | grep "\.txt$"
```

Swap all vowels in a file listing with 'u'
```bash
ls -l | sed -e "s/[aeio]/u/g"
```

# Programming

## Variables

Variable assignments must not have spaces around the = sign:
```bash
some_variable_name="this is a string"
```

Read value of a variable with a $ in front of variable name
```bash
echo the value of some_variable_name is $some_variable_name
```

---

## Exporting Variables

A copy of a variable defined within a script can be copied into your command-line environment, which makes it available to any other scripts you run
```bash
export some_variable_name
```

Functions can also be exported
```bash
export -f some_function_name
```

See what has been exported to the command-line:
```bash
export
```

---

## Aliases

Aliases allow you to set other names for common commands.

```bash
ll="ls -l"
```

To execute a command alias:
```bash
$ll
```

See all aliases set in the shell
```bash
alias
```

---

## Conditionals

bash supports the usual if/else if/else controls:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
T1="foo"
T2="bar"
if [ "$T1" == "$T2" ]; then
    echo expression evaluated as true
else
    echo expression evaluated as false
fi
```

---

## Loops

bash supports both `for` and `while` loops:

For:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in $( ls ); do
    echo item: $i
done
```

While:
```bash
#!/bin/bash 
COUNTER=0
while [  $COUNTER -lt 10 ]; do
	echo The counter is $COUNTER
	let COUNTER=COUNTER+1 
done
```

---

## Functions

A function with a local variable:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
HELLO=Hello 
function hello {
        local HELLO=World
        echo $HELLO
}
echo $HELLO
hello
echo $HELLO
```

A function with an argument:
```bash
#!/bin/bash 
function e {
    echo $1 
}  
e Hello
e World
```

# Grouping

---

## Parentheses

Commands grouped within parentheses are separate processes. Variables defined within the sub-process are not shared with the parent process.
```bash
a=1
(
a=2
)
echo $a
# prints 1
```

---

## Braces

Commands grouped with braces do not spawn a sub-process, so variables therein are shared:
```bash
a=1
{
a=2
}
echo $a
# prints 2
```

# Automation

---

## Startup Scripts

Bash is used for everyday automation by developers:
- Every time a user logs into a user logs in, a bash script named `.bash_profile` is automatically run.
- Every time a new command shell is started, a script named `.bash_rc` is automatically run.

Place whatever bash commands you want in files by either of these names in your user account home directory in order to take advantage of this feature.

---

## Software Development Automation

Agile Software Developers depend upon automation to simplify and speed up many pedestrian tasks.  For example, in "continuous integration" unit tests are automatically execute anytime the codebasse in version control is modified.

A fragment of such a script that could be used in Jenkins, an automation tool:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [[ $BRANCH_NAME == "master" ]] || [[ $BRANCH_NAME == "master_dev" ]]
then
    ./runUnitTests.sh $REPOSITORY_NAME $BASE_BUILD_CORE $BRANCH_NAME $BUILD_NUMBER || echo "The npm may fail but the report exists"
fi
```
