# Overview

Individual personality psychology and group psychology play an important role in team harmony and performance.

While there is no single formula for success, having an understanding of how you perceive otherss and are yourself perceived by others may help.

# The Human Condition

---

## Concept

As popularized in the early part of the 20th century by Freud's "[Civilization and its Discontents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_and_Its_Discontents)" and Herman Hesse's "[Steppenwolf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppenwolf_(novel))", humans have long been accused of harboring conflicting motivations:
- to be an individual
- to belong to a group

---

## Solution

While there is no solution, there are strategies for mitigating the impact of this conflict on team work.

For team harmony, it may help to understand an individual's motivations and try to provide for their needs.

## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

In the mid-20th century, a social scientist named Abraham Maslow proposed a set of needs of humans in order to explain motivation (or the lack thereof):
1. physiological needs - food, water, sleep, shelter, etc.
2. safety - personal, financial, and other forms of safety
3. social belonging - a need for the feeling of belongingness, social acceptance, and love
4. esteem - recognition, respect, and the need for status
5. self-actualization - a desire to accomplish everything one can... to maximize one's potential!

The idea was that you cannot achieve higher needs without satisfying lower needs.

## Maslow's Pyramid

Where does software development fit in this pyramid?

## Tricks of the trade

Safety:
- no guns at work
- systems for handling reports of abuse and harrassment

Social belonging:
- provide communal facilities and activities
- encourage informal communication

Esteem:
- recognize achievements of individuals
- give appropriate rewards

Self-realization:
- training - people want to learn more
- responsibility - let individuals have a stake in the work

# Team Size

Many wise people have tried to find the perfect size team for good performance.

Jeff Bezos is famous for the "two pizza" team - a team should only be as large as can be fed with two pizzas.
