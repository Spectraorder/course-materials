# Ready, Set, Go!

---

## Kickoff

Teams are by now well into their projects.  Let's make sure your workflow and expectations are in order.

---

## Sprints

Work is divided into increments:
- Sprint 0 - the current sprint
- Sprint 1
- Sprint 2
- Sprint 3
- Sprint 4

---

## Expectations

- Teams communicate through [Slack](#slack)
- Teams use [GitHub](#github) as both a central code repository and a project management tool
- The [Product Backlog](#product-backlog) represents the full list of user requirements of the project
- Teams estimate work using [Planning Poker](#planning-poker) cards
- A [Sprint Backlog](#sprint backlog) shows which user requirements are being worked on during the current Sprint
- A [Task Boards](#task-boards) shows the up-to-date status of all work at all times
- Individuals use [Git](#git) systematically to isolate code and track changes
- Teams meet in person for [Daily Standups](#daily-standups)
- At the end of each Sprint is the release of a working, but incomplete, product.

# Slack

---

## Channels

Each team must have two private channels set up in Slack, e.g.:
- `team_octapus` - general discussion
- `team_octapus_standups` - after each standup, document each member's answers to the three questions

Key stakeholders - professor, tutor, grader - must be invited.

---

## Organization

Each team is a member of the larger course organization.

All teams are using the same general technologies.

Communicate.  Help each other.  Take initiative.

---

## Coffee & Donuts

A bot named `@donut` lives in Slack.  

@donut will randomly pair organization members together every week and invite them to go out for coffee and donuts (or whatever).

Post a pick of your @donut date to the `#donut-friends` channel for extra credit.  Tag the people in the photo with their Slack handles.

---

name: github

# GitHub

---

## Repository

All team members have access to their project's GitHub repository.

All repositories must include:
- README.md - an always up-to-date overview of the project
- CONTRIBUTING.md - detailed instructions that govern participation in the project
- REQUIREMENTS.md - initial product requirements that will be out-of-date soon

---

## Gitignore

Each repository must include a file named `.gitignore` in the root directory that instructs git to not track certain files and directories.

Make sure you do not track platform code, 3rd party library code, or any files containing authentication credentials in version control.

Uses [this example `.gitignore` file](https://gist.github.com/bloombar/1bbca4aafb267920ac220864d99d6c8f) as a starting point.

# Product Backlog

---

## User Stories

Before work on a project can begin, it must have an initial Product Backlog - a set of user requirements for the project written in User Story form.

---

## Issues

Every GitHub repository has an `Issues` tab where User Stories in the Product Backlog should be written and stored.

---

## Label

Create an Issue for each User Story in the Product Backlog and assign it the `user story` label to differentiate it from other types of Issues.

---

name: issue-numbers

## Issue Numbers

Once created, each Issue in GitHub is automatically assigned a unique Issue number.  

So each User Story in the Product Backlog has a unique ID number.

# Planning Poker

---

## Fibonacci

Every team must print a set of fibonacci-based planning poker cards for each team member.  Find a deck you like or design your own.

Include a link to your deck on the CONTRIBUTING.md file.

---

## Work Estimation

At the start of each Sprint, team members discuss each User Story they are considering including in the new Sprint.

The group quickly assigns each User Story an estimated level of effort using Planning Poker.

# Sprint Backlogs

---

## Selecting User Stories

Those User Stories selected for the current Sprint are added to the Sprint Backlog.

In addition to the basic requirements for User Stories in the [Product Backlog](#product-backlog), User Stories in the Sprint Backlog must be assigned:
- a GitHub Milestone representing the current Sprint
- an Estimate of Effort required to complete the User Story
- a set of Acceptance Criteria for the User Story

---

## Tasks

Each User Story selected for the current Sprint is immediately broken up into Tasks.

A `Task` is a unit of work that would ideally take one developer one day.

Requirements:
- Each Task is saved as a GitHub Issue with the label, "task".
- The description of each Task includes a reference to the User Story to which it belongs - writing the User Story's Issue ID number, e.g. #22, in the Task description will create a link to it.
- Each Task is assigned the GitHub Milestone representing the current Sprint.
- Each Task is assigned to a specific developer

---

## Spikes

Any work to be done that does not relate directly to a user requirement is documented as a Spike.

In GitHub, spikes are treated like Tasks in all respects except that they are labeled "spike", not "task".

Requirements:
- Each Spike is saved as a GitHub Issue with the label, "spike".
- Each Spike is assigned the GitHub Milestone representing the current Sprint.
- Each Spike is assigned to a specific developer

---

## Proper Attribution

If multiple developers must perform the same Spike but the nature of the work requires it to be done independently, it must be split into separate Spikes with eaach assigned to a single team member.

For example, if multiple team members must learn Node.js, then each team member has an individual responsibility to do this, and there must be a distinct Spike on the Task Board for each team member indicating the status of their work completing this.

---

# Task Boards

---

## Concept

Each GitHub repository has a `Projects` tab, where Task Boards can be made.

Make one Task Board for each Sprint.  Call them:
- Sprint 0 Task Board
- Sprint 1 Task Board
- Sprint 2 Task Board
- Sprint 3 Task Board
- Sprint 4 Task Board

---

## Columns

Each Task Board must have the following columns:
- *Sprint Backlog (User Stories)* - the list of User Stories selected for this Sprint.
- *To Do (Tasks)* - the list of Tasks and Spikes that have not yet begun
- *In Process (Tasks)* - the list of Tasks and Spikes that are currently being worked on 
- *Awaiting Review (Tasks)* - the list of Tasks and Spikes that are complete and awaiting peer review
- *Done (Tasks)* - the list of Tasks and Spikes that are complete and have passed peer review.

---

## Starting State

At the start of each Sprint, the current Task Board in GitHub must contain:
- the full list of User Stories selected for this Sprint in the "Sprint Backlog (User Stories)" column
- the full list of Tasks and Spikes in the "To Do (Tasks)" column

---

## Changing State

The state of the Task Board must be kept up-to-date at all times.

User Stories always stay in the "Sprint Backlog" column.

As developers work on their own assigned Tasks and Spikes, they are personally responsible for moving them to the appropriate columns.

---

## Missing Work

If you are doing work that is not accurately reflected on the Task Board, you are not doing Agile Development.

Your grade depends upon you accurately listing all work you are doing on the Task Board at all times.

# Git

---

## Matching Credentials

The Git username and email you use on your development machine must match your GitHub account username and email.

---

## Clone

Each team member must clone the remote GitHub repository to their development machine.

---

## Branches

Make all changes to the code in isolated branches.  Never work directly in the `master` branch.

Name branches after the User Story and Task/Spike which they are intended to implement, e.g. 

A branch intended to implement Task #9, which is part of User Story #13:
```
user-story/13/task/9/user-login
```

A branch intended to implement Task #9, which is part of User Story #13:
```
spike/27/learn-react-js
```

# Daily Standups

---

## Concept

Every morning, the entire development team gets together.  Everyone quickly and honestly answers three questions:
1. What did you do yesterday (or since last meeting)?
2. What are you doing today (or until next meeting)?
3. Do you have any problems that are blocking your progress?

---

## Documentation

The current Scrum Master must document each team member's answers to the three questions and post them to their team's Slack standups channel.

Include the Slack handle of each member and their responses, e.g.

```
@foo_barstein:
- did: Completed 95% unit testing code coverage of codebase
- doing: Implementing the Observer design pattern
- blocking: Nothing
```

---

## Honesty

All teams must include in their Team Norms that team members agree to answer the Daily Standup three questions honestly and fully.

It is in all team members' interests to report blocking problems or underperforming team members to the stakeholders immediately.

If a team member is doing the same work for several Standups in a row, yet is not reporting any blocking problems, this is a sign of a major problem.
