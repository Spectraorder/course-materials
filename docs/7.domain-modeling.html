# Overview

# Overview

Developing and documenting a conceptual model of the *things* that exist within the domain of the project, and the interrelationships among those *things*.

Domain models help break down and understand the *problem space* within which work will be performed.

---

# Overview

Whereas use cases and user stories help understand the users and their interactions with the system, domain modeling helps understand the internals of the system to be built.

---

# Overview
## Living documentation

Domain models are *living documents*.  They are continually refined as needed.

They are never *done* and never *exhaustive*.  They are *conversational* in nature.

They provide only as much information as is useful to those involved in a project.

---

# Overview
## Living documentation

As you work on a project, your understanding of the domain expands.

Keeping an up-to-date domain model can help all involved agree on the details of the domain.

# Entities

---

# Entities

Entities are the *things* that exist in the domain of a project that must be documented.

Entities may be people, processes, system components, databases, or any other *noun*.

---

# Entities
## Process

Identifying *entities* is easy (if you have written documentation of the project).
- Go through all existing documentation and write down all the *nouns*.
- Consolidate any synonyms that describe the same *thing*.
- Remove any *nouns* that are, in fact, attributes or properties of other *nouns* - these are not entities.

# Entities
## Diagramming

Domain models follows a standardized modeling style defined by the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a commonly-used diagramming language.
- Entities are placed in rectangles.

# Relationships

---

# Relationships

Once *entities* are established, document the *relationships* or *interactions* among them.
- How many of each *entity* are involved in the relationship? This is the *multiplicity of the relationship

# Relationships
## Diagramming

Domain models follows a standardized modeling style defined by the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a commonly-used diagramming language.
- Relationships are drawn as lines between the related entities.
- The *multiplicity*, or how many instances of each entity are involved in a given relationship, are notated next to the relevant entity.

# Entity-Relationship Diagrams

# Entity-Relationship Diagrams

In database design, very similar diagrams are created, called Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD).
- The two are done for different purposes, but the style of diagram is very similar.
