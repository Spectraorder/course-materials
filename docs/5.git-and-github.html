# Introductions

# Introductions
## Git

The world's most popular open source version control system.
- **Distributed** - all developers maintain and share the code in their own local repositories, with no single central authority.
- **Repository versioning** - a new version number is issued for the repository as a whole, even when only one file has changed.
- Created by **Linus Torvalds** to help Linux kernel developers collaborate

---

# Introductions
## GitHub

A web app used for hosting remote Git repositoriess.
- Free hosting of public open-source projects
- Free hosting of private projects for students (or so I hear)
- Acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in 2018

# Three-Tier Model

---

template: tiers
name: tiers-1

Git version control depends upon three tiers, or three places where code is stored.
- Working copy
- Staging index 
- Repository

---

template: tiers
name: tiers-2

## Working copy
The copy of the files that a developer works on.  

---

template: tiers-2
name: tiers-3

- Not tracked by git.

---

template: tiers
name: tiers-4

## Staging index
A holding area for changes thata *might* be included in the project's official history.

---

template: tiers-4
name: tiers-5

- Allows developers pick and choose which changed files to include in the next commit to the repository

---

template: tiers-5
name: tiers-6

- [Read more](https://gitolite.com/uses-of-index.html) about some benefits of this

---

template: tiers-6
name: tiers-7

```bash
git add .
```

---

template: tiers
name: tiers-8

## Repository
The official history of the project, including the history of all committed files.

---

template: tiers-8
name: tiers-9

- With each commit, changed files in the staging index are moved to the repository

---

template: tiers-9
name: tiers-10

- A short message describes the chanes included in each commit

---

template: tiers-10
name: tiers-11

```bash
git commit -m "Updating slide about git repositories"
```

---

name: terminology

# Git Terminology

---

# Git Terminology

A few terms we must familiarize ourselves with.
- Clone
- Fork
- Master
- Branch
- Remote
- Push
- Pull
- Merge

---

# Git Terminology
## Clone

A new repository made by copying an existing repository.
- Typically involves creating a new local repository that is a copy of an existing remote repository.
- The new repository automatically keeps a link to the `origin` remote repository from which it came.

---

# Git Terminology
## Fork

Not a Git term, but rather a term used by remote repository hosting providers such as GitHub.

A fancy word for creating a remote clone of a remote repository.

---

# Git Terminology
## Master

The term for the `trunk` line of code in Git.

Git treats `master` as a branch with a special name.

---

# Git Terminology
## Branch

The term for an offshoot of the `trunk` line of code in Git.

---

# Git Terminology
## Remote

A term used to mean a remote repository that the local repository is linked to.
- Typically, this refers to the remote repository from which a local repository was cloned.
- Can be given nicknames, such as "origin" or "upstream"

---

# Git Terminology
## Push

Upload changes from the local repository to a remote repository.

---

# Git Terminology
## Pull

Download changes from a remote repository to the local repository.
- It's good practice to `pull` before you `push`.

---

# Git Terminology
## Merge

Take the changes from one branch or repository and incorporate them into another branch or repository.

---

name: local-repository

# Creating a Local Repository

---

# Creating a Local Repository

A local repository can be created in one of two ways:
- From scratch
- As a clone of another repository

---

# Creating a Local Repository
## From scratch

```bash
mkdir project0
cd project0
git init
```

---

# Creating a Local Repository
## From scratch

If you later decide to link a local repository to a remote repository:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

---

# Creating a Local Repository
## As a clone of another repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

---

name: tracking

# Tracking Changes with the Local Repository

---

# Tracking Changes with the Local Repository

Changes in the Working Copy (adding, modifying, or deleting files) are not tracked.

Files must be added to the staging index in order to be tracked.

---

# Tracking Changes with the Local Repository
## Add files to the staging index

Make any changes you desire.

Then add all the modified files in working copy to the staging index:
```bash
git add .
```

---

name: committing

# Committing Changes to the Local Repository

---

# Committing Changes to the Local Repository

The staging index does not maintain the history of all changes.

Changes must be moved to the repository in order to be fully archived.

---

# Committing Changes to the Local Repository
## Committing changes to the repository

```bash
git commit -m 'resolving bug #23'
```

---

name: sharing

# Sharing Changes with Other Developers

---

# Sharing Changes with Other Developers

Any changes to the local repository must usually be shared with other developers.

For this reason, they should frequently be uploaded to a shared remote repository.

---

# Sharing Changes with Other Developers
## Pushing changes to the remote repository

Push the code in the current branch from the local repository to the branch named 'master' on the remote repository called 'origin':
```bash
git pull
git push -u origin master
```

Or, if you are already in the 'master' branch and the remote named 'origin' has already been defined:
```bash
git pull
git push
```

---

name: conflicts

# Merge Conflicts

---

# Conflicts

Conflicts may occur in a number of scenarios:
- When `pulling` code from a remote repository to a local repository.
- When `pushing` code from a local repository to a remote repository.
- When merging code from one branch into another.
- When merging code from one repository into another.

---

# Conflicts

Git will merge code automatically, if possible, and ask the developer to do it themselves, if not.

---


# Configuration

---

# Configuration
name: configuration

Several important configurations that must be completed prior to versioning:
- username and email address
- .gitignore

---

# Configuration
## Username

Username and email in Git must match exactly any username and email set up on GitHub:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Foo Barstein"
git config --global user.email "fb1258@nyu.edu"
```

---

# Configuration
## .gitignore

A file in the project directory named `.gitignore` instructs Git to ignore certain files or directories.

This *absolutely must* include instructions to ignore any platform code and 3rd party modules.

Example: https://gist.github.com/bloombar/1bbca4aafb267920ac220864d99d6c8f
