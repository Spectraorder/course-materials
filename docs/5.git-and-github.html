# Introductions

---

template: introductions
name: git-intro

## Git

The world's most popular open source version control system.
---

template: git-intro
name: git-intro-1

- **Distributed** - all developers maintain and share the code in their own local repositories, with no single central authority.
---

template: git-intro-1
name: git-intro-2

- **Repository versioning** - a new version number is issued for the repository as a whole, even when only one file has changed.
---

template: git-intro-2
name: git-intro-3

- Created by **Linus Torvalds** to help Linux kernel developers collaborate

---

template: introductions
name: github-intro

## GitHub

A web app used for hosting remote Git repositories.
---

template: github-intro
name: github-intro-1

- Free hosting of public open-source projects
---

template: github-intro-1
name: github-intro-2

- Free hosting of private projects for students (or so I hear)
---

template: github-intro-2
name: github-intro-3

- Acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion in 2018

---

name: tiers

# Three-Tier Model

---

template: tiers
name: tiers-1

Git version control depends upon three tiers, or three places where files are stored.
- Working copy
- Staging index 
- Repository

![Git tiers](../images/git_tiers.png)

---

template: tiers
name: tiers-2

## Working copy
The copy of the files that a developer works on.  

---

template: tiers-2
name: tiers-3

- Not tracked by git.

---

template: tiers-3
name: tiers-4

- Your 'normal' files you are familiar with.

---

template: tiers-4
name: tiers-35

![Working tree](../images/git_working_tree.png)

---

template: tiers
name: staging-index

## Staging index
A holding area for changes thata *might* be included in the project's official history.

---

template: staging-index
name: staging-index-1

- Allows developers pick and choose which changed files to include in the next commit to the repository

---

template: staging-index-1
name: staging-index-2

- [Read more](https://gitolite.com/uses-of-index.html) about some benefits of this

---

template: staging-index-2
name: staging-index-3

![Staging index](../images/git_staging_index.png)

---

template: staging-index
name: staging-index-4

```bash
# add any changed files within the working directory to the staging index
git add .
```

---

template: staging-index-4
name: staging-index-5

```bash
# add only one file to the staging index
git add my_staging_index_slide.md
```

---

template: tiers
name: repository

## Repository
The official history of the project, including the history of all committed files.

---

template: repository
name: repository-1

- With each commit, changed files in the staging index are moved to the repository

---

template: repository-1
name: repository-2

- A short message describes the chanes included in each commit

---

template: repository-2
name: repository-3

![Repository](../images/git_repository.png)

---

template: repository
name: repository-4

```bash
# commit any files in the staging index to the repository
git commit -m "Updating slide about git repositories"
```

# Git Terminology

---

template: terminology
name: terminology-1

A few terms we must familiarize ourselves with.
- Clone
- Fork
- Master
- Branch
- Remote
- Pull
- Push
- Merge
- Fetch

---

template: terminology
name: clone

## Clone
A new repository made by copying files from an existing repository.

---

template: clone
name: clone-1

- Typically involves creating a new local repository that is a copy of an existing remote repository.

---

template: clone-1
name: clone-2

- The new repository automatically keeps a link to the `origin` remote repository from which it came.

---

template: clone-2
name: clone-3

```bash
# clone a remote repository onto the local machine
git clone https://github.com/your-github-handle/your-repository-name.git
```
---

template: clone
name: clone-4

![Clone](../images/git_clone.png)

---

template: terminology
name: fork

## Fork
Not a Git term, but rather a term used by remote repository hosting providers such as GitHub.

---

template: fork
name: fork-1

- A fancy word for creating a remote [clone](#clone) of a remote repository.

---

template: fork-1
name: fork-2

- A fork of a GitHub repository creates a clone of that repository in the active user's own GitHub account

---

template: fork
name: fork-3

![Fork](../images/git_fork.png)

---

template: terminology
name: master

## Master
The Git term for the `trunk` line of code.

---

template: master
name: master-1

- The default line of code that all commits are placed into unless other branch lines are created.

---

template: master-1
name: master-2

![Master branch](../images/git_master.png)

---

template: terminology
name: branch

## Branch
The term for an offshoot of the `trunk` or `master` line of code.

---

template: branch
name: branch-1

- creating a branch allows developers to work on new code in isolation with no effect on the main `trunk` line.

---

template: branch-1
name: branch-2

- code in a branch can be `merged` into the trunk branch at any time, if desired

---

template: branch-2
name: branch-3

![Feature branch](../images/git_branch.png)

---

template: branch
name: branch-4

```bash
# see a list of all branches in the local repository
git branch
```

---

template: branch-4
name: branch-5

```bash
# create a new branch
git branch experiment1
```

---

template: branch-5
name: branch-6

```bash
# switch to the new branch
git checkout experiment1
```

--

template: branch-6
name: branch-7

```bash
# switch back to the master branch
git checkout master
```

---

template: terminology
name: remote

## Remote
A term used to mean a remote repository that the local repository is linked to.

---

template: remote
name: remote-1

- Typically, this refers to the remote repository from which a local repository was cloned.

---

template: remote-1
name: remote-2

- The nickname `origin` is usually used to refer to the original remote repository from which the local repository was cloned.

---

template: remote-2
name: remote-3

- The nickname `upstream` is also sometimes used to refer to a remote repository from which the `origin` repository was originally forked.

---

template: remote
name: remote-4

```bash
# view a list of all currently known remotes
git remote -v
```

---

template: remote-4
name: remote-5

```bash
# inform git of a remote and give it the nickname 'origin'
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-github-handle/your-repository-name.git
```

---

template: remote-5
name: remote-6

```bash
# inform git of a remote and give it the nickname 'upstream'
git remote add upstream https://github.com/some-other-github-handle/some-other-repository-name.git
```

---

template: terminology
name: pull

## Pull

Download and merge any changes *in the current branch* from a remote repository to the local repository.

---

template: pull
name: pull-1

- It's good practice to `pull` before you `push`.

---

template: pull-1
name: pull-2

![Pull](../images/git_pull.png)

---

template: pull
name: pull-3

```bash
# download any changes in the master branch from the 'origin' remote repository to the local repository
git pull origin master
```

---

template: pull-3
name: pull-4

```bash
# download any changes in the master branch from the 'upstream' remote repository to the local repository
git pull upstream master
```

---

template: terminology
name: push

## Push
Upload changes from the local repository to a remote repository.

---

template: push
name: push-1

![Push](../images/git_push.png)

---

template: push
name: push-2

```bash
# Upload any changs in the master branch from the local repository to the 'origin' remote repository
git push origin master
```

---

template: push-2
name: push-3

```bash
# Upload any changs in the master branch from the local repository to the 'upstream' remote repository
git push upstream master
```

---

template: terminology
name: fetch

## Fetch
Download *all branches* from a remote repository to the local repository.

---

template: fetch
name: fetch-1

- This can be useful to see changes made by others

---

template: fetch-1
name: fetch-2

```bash
# download all branches from the 'origin' remote repository
git fetch origin
```

---

template: fetch-2
name: fetch-3

```bash
# download all branches from the 'upstream' remote repository
git fetch upstream
```

---

template: terminology
name: merge

## Merge
Take the changes from one branch or repository and incorporate them into another branch or repository.

---

template: merge
name: merge-1

- If both branches include recent changes to the same lines of code, `git` will inform you of a conflict.

---

template: merge-1
name: merge-2

- Any such merge conflicts must be manually resolved using your preferred editor.

---

template: merge-2
name: merge-3

![Merge](../images/git_merge.png)

---

template: merge
name: merge-4

- A typical workflow:

```bash
# download the latest code from the 'origin' remote, including any and all branches
git fetch origin

# switch to a branch whose code you want to merge into the master branch
# add the `-b` flag if this branch has not yet been created before
git checkout some-branch-name

# make some chages to the code in this branch, if desired using your preferred editor

# switch back to the master branch
git checkout master

# incorporaate any changes in the branch into the code in the master branch
git merge some-branch-name

# delete the branch now that we're done with it
git branch -d some-branch-name
```

---

name: local-repository

# Creating a Local Repository

---

template: local-repository

A local repository can be created in one of two ways:
- From scratch
- As a clone of another repository

---

template: local-repository

## From scratch

```bash
mkdir project0
cd project0
git init
```

---

template: local-repository

## From scratch

If you later decide to link a local repository to a remote repository:
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

---

template: local-repository

## As a clone of another repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY.git
```

---

name: tracking

# Tracking Changes with the Local Repository

---

template: tracking

Changes in the Working Copy (adding, modifying, or deleting files) are not tracked.

Files must be added to the staging index in order to be tracked.

---

template: tracking

## Add files to the staging index

Make any changes you desire.

Then add all the modified files in working copy to the staging index:
```bash
git add .
```

---

name: committing

# Committing Changes to the Local Repository

---

template: committing

The staging index does not maintain the history of all changes.

Changes must be moved to the repository in order to be fully archived.

---

template: committing
## Committing changes to the repository

```bash
git commit -m 'resolving bug #23'
```

---

name: sharing

# Sharing Changes with Other Developers

---

template: sharing

Any changes to the local repository must usually be shared with other developers.

For this reason, they should frequently be uploaded to a shared remote repository.

---

template: sharing
## Pushing changes to the remote repository

Push the code in the current branch from the local repository to the branch named 'master' on the remote repository called 'origin':
```bash
git pull
git push -u origin master
```

Or, if you are already in the 'master' branch and the remote named 'origin' has already been defined:
```bash
git pull
git push
```

---

name: conflicts

# Merge Conflicts

---

template: conflicts

Conflicts may occur in a number of scenarios:
- When `pulling` code from a remote repository to a local repository.
- When `pushing` code from a local repository to a remote repository.
- When merging code from one branch into another.
- When merging code from one repository into another.

---

template: conflicts

Git will merge code automatically, if possible, and ask the developer to do it themselves, if not.

---

name: configuration

# Configuration

---

template: configuration

Several important configurations that must be completed prior to versioning:
- username and email address
- .gitignore

---

template: configuration

## Username

Username and email in Git must match exactly any username and email set up on GitHub:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Foo Barstein"
git config --global user.email "fb1258@nyu.edu"
```

---

template: configuration

## .gitignore

A file in the project directory named `.gitignore` instructs Git to ignore certain files or directories.

This *absolutely must* include instructions to ignore any platform code and 3rd party modules.

Example: https://gist.github.com/bloombar/1bbca4aafb267920ac220864d99d6c8f
