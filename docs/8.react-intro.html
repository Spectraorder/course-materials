## Concept

A component is a modular, reusable user interface element.
- Javascript to define a components can be written in one of two ways: as a class, or as a function

---

template: components
name: components-1

## Component classes
Defining a component with a Javascript class is the most common way, because it was the original way React designed them.

Here is a component class named `Hello` that represents a paragraph of text.

```javascript
class Hello extends Component{
    render(){
        return <p>Hello world!</p>
    }
}
```

## Component functions
Defining a component as a function simplifies the code a bit.

Here is a component function named `Hello` that represents a paragraph of text.

```javascript
function Hello(){
    return <p>Hello world!</p>
}
```

And if you know arrow functions, it can also be written this way:
```javascript
const Hello = () => <p>Hello world!</p>;
```
