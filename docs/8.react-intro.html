## Concept
React.js is a tool for auto-generating HTML, CSS, and browser-based Javascript for web app client interfaces.
- created and maintained by Facebook
- built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - a popular Javascript runtime environment most often used for back-end app development.
- React.js scripts are written in Javascript with the addition of [React's unique JSX syntax](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

## Choice of approach
- HTML & CSS are *quite simple* languages for indicating the content and style of web pages, respectively.
- Javascript is a *quite complex* language with many unusual but interesting features.
- You may wonder why anyone would desire to exhange code written in such simple languages with code written in a highly complex language.

## A front-end generator

React.js programs themselves are not web apps - they comprise neither the front nor the back end.
- React.js programs are run in order to generate client-side (i.e. front-end) HTML, CSS, and browser-based Javascript code.
- These generated codes together comprise the front-end of an application.

---

## Components are standardized, reusable, and shareable
The key value proposition of React.js is that it produces standardized reusable code.
- comes with basic components corresponding to HTML elements.
- allows for simple creation of reusable custom components
- leverages the Node.js Package Manager (NPM) to remove any difficulty from downloading, installing, and configuring additional 3rd-party components.

# A Word About HTML & CSS

---

template: html-css
name: html-css-1

## Concept
Any **web browser** understands the three core front-end web technologies:
- **Hypertext Markup Language** (HTML) - controls the content present on the web page
- **Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS) - controls the visual style of the content on the web page
- **Javascript** (JS) - controls the iteractive behavior of the web page (how does the page change when a user clicks, types, moves them mouse, etc)

---

template: html-css
name: html-css-2

## Javascript
In addition to controlling the interactive behaviors of web pages running in web browsers, Javascript has found new life in other environments:
- writing Javascript to autogenerate HTML and CSS for the front-end of a web app by using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), of course.
- web [browser extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension) written in Javascript.
- server-side programming with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- scripts to automate image editing processes in [Adobe Creative Suite](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/scripting.html).
- interactive music and video composition with Cycling 74's [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/).
- database queries in [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/), and others.
- [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) is designed to be a Javascript-like language that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

## HTML in three slides (slide 1)
For any given web page, HTML code indicates the type of content to show as well as each piece of content's purpose, or semantic meaning.
- A level 1 heading: `<h1>Puppies For Sale</h1>`
- A paragraph: `<p>Buy now while supplies last!</p>`
- An image of a lonely puppy: `<img src="images/lonely_puppy.jpg" />`
- An article with a level 1 heading, an image of a sad puppy, and a paragraph with a link to another web page:
```html
<article>
        <h1>Puppies For Sale</h1>
        <img src="images/lonely_puppy.jpg" />
        <p>
            Buy now while supplies last!
            <a href="puppies.html">Learn more</a>
        </p>
</article>
```

## HTML in three slides (slide 2)
Many web sites see the same basic content structures repeated across multiple pages, or repeated within a single page.  
[Try it!](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/adgrp9zb/5/)
```html
<section>
    <!-- the first article -->
    <article>
        <h1>Puppies For Sale</h1>
        <img src="images/lonely_puppy.jpg" />
        <p>
            Buy now while supplies last!
            <a href="puppies.html">Learn more</a>
        </p>
    </article>
    <!-- the second article... notice its structural similarity to the first -->
    <article>
        <h1>Kittens For Sale</h1>
        <img src="images/sad_kitten.jpg" />
        <p>
            Get 'em while they're hot!
            <a href="kittens.html">Learn more</a>
        </p>
    </article>
</section>
```

## HTML in three slides (slide 3)
Actually, we're more-or-less finished explaining HTML in 2 slides. 

What you just learned is how to code for content that will be displayed in the `body` of a web page - the part of an HTML document that represents the visible content.
- Learn [a bit more about HTML documents](https://nyu-computer-science.github.io/web-design/html/).

## CSS in three slides (slide 1)
For any given web page, CSS code indicates the style to use for the content indicated by the HTML.
- Give *all* level 2 headings green text: `h2 { color: green; }`
- Give *all* paragraphs a pink background: `p { background-color: pink; }`
- Set the dimensions of *all* images: `img { width: 200px; height: 300px; }`
- Give *all* articles a thick pink dotted border, a bold `serif` font, and lots of space around the contents inside them:
```css
article {
        border: 10px dotted pink;
        font-family: georgia;
        font-weight: bold;
        padding: 20px;
}
```

## CSS in three slides (slide 2)
Let's say you had four paragraphs, and wanted to style only two of them the same.  Mark them with a `class` attribute in the HTML.  If you want to uniquely style only one, mark it with an `id` attribute:
```html
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
<p class="my_favorite_paragraphs">Ipsum dolor sit amet lorem.</p>
<p id="a_really_special_paragraph">Dolor sit amet lorem ipsum.</p>
<p class="my_favorite_paragraphs">Ipsum dolor sit amet lorem.</p>
```

And select only the paragraphs that match these attributes in the CSS:
```css
p.my_favorite_paragraphs {
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px; /* a drop shadow */
}
p#a_really_special_paragraph {
    font-size: 24px; /* relatively big */
}
```

## CSS in three slides (slide 3)
That's almost it.  But there is one very important part of CSS code that we will not address here is how you place elements onto the web page in the location where you want them to go.

There are a variety of ways... the latest greatest is to use so-called CSS Flexbox - see [a simple example](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/adgrp9zb/13/) - this also is what React uses.
- First learn [more about basic CSS](https://nyu-computer-science.github.io/web-design/css/).
- Then learn [more about layouts with CSS flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox).

## Auto-generating HTML & CSS
Now that you have a mastery of HTML & CSS (!), you will use React.js to autogenerate them for you.
- React allows you to easily write reusable bits of HTML, CSS, and browser-based Javascript code called **components**.
- For example, you can define a template for an `article` that contains a heading, photo, and paragraph, and then reuse that template across many pages or in many places within one page.

[Try it!](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/1j4udLtk/30/)

name: setup

# React setup

---

template: setup
name: setup-1

## Install Node.js
Since React.js is built to run in it, a developer must first [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- pick the latest stable version for your system

---

template: setup
name: setup-2

## Create project directories
If creating a React app from scratch, first create project directory where everything related to your app - front-end, back-end, and React code - will reside.

```bash
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
```

Since you'll eventually need it, take the opportunity to make a sub-directory for the back-end code.
```bash
mkdir back-end
```

---

template: setup
name: setup-3

## Create a starter React app
In the project directory, create a React starter project - this will create the basic directory structure, install any necessary dependencies, set up configuration files, and include simple React app starter code that is immediately runnable.
- Call the React app `front-end`, since it will be used to generate the front-end of a web app - this will create a `front-end` sub-directory where all React code will live.
```bash
npx create-react-app front-end
```

---

template: setup
name: setup-4

## Try it out
To preview the app in a non-optimal state, try running it.

```bash
cd front-end
npm start
```

This will run the script named `start` automatically included in the new app's configuration file - it launches the app.
- All Node.js-based applications that use Node's built-in package manager, `npm`, have a configuration file like this named `package.json`.

---

template: setup
name: setup-5

## Try generating HTML, CSS, and Javascript files
The previous command previews the app.  To generate the proper HTML, CSS, and browser-based Javascript files that will ultimately comprise the app front-end, run the following:
```bash
npm run build
```

This will run the script named `build` automatically included in the `package.json` configuration file.
- A new sub-directory named `build` will contain the generated files.

---

template: setup
name: setup-6

## Poke around the file system
You should familiarize with the React app files and directories.
- `build/` - where the generated HTML, CSS, and browser-based Javascript will automatically be placed.  Don't touch this!
- `node_modules/` - where modules that this app depends upon will be automatically installed. Don't touch this!
- `public/` - contains any static assets that should be copied into `build/` by the generator, such as favicon images, logo images, etc.
- `src/` - contains the source code files that make up your app... this is where you will work on code
- `src/index.js` - code that creates the outline of a basic HTML page and tells React to place the component named `App` onto the page. Don't touch this!
- `src/index.css` - CSS code for basic page-wide style settings.
- `src/App.js` - code for the `App` component loaded onto the page.
- `src/App.css` - CSS code for styling the App component.
- `package.json` - the standard `npm` type of configuration file with lots of app settings and a complete list of dependencies

---

template: setup
name: setup-3

## Clone a React app
If cloning an existing React app stored in a Git remote repository, use `git clone`, as with any git repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/some-username/my-app.git
```

This will create a new directory named `my-app` (or whatever name the repository had) where all the project files are stored.

Navigate into this directory and run `npm install` in order to install any necessary dependencies for this project listed in the project's `package.json` configutation file.
```bash
npm install
```

# Components

---

template: components
name: components-1

## Concept

A component is a modular, reusable user interface element.
- Javascript to define a components can be written in one of two ways: as a class, or as a function

---

template: components
name: components-1

## Component classes
Defining a component with a Javascript class is the most common way, because it was the original way React designed them.

Here is a component class named `Hello` that represents a paragraph of text.

```javascript
class Hello extends Component{
    render(){
        return <p>Hello world!</p>
    }
}
```

---

template: components
name: components-2

## Component functions
Defining a component as a function is now the preferred way and simplifies the code a bit.
```javascript
function Hello(){
    return <p>Hello world!</p>
}
```

The same function can be written this way, if you remember your fat arrow syntax:
```javascript
const Hello = () => <p>Hello world!</p>;
```

## JSX
This embedding of HTML-like code into the middle of Javascript code is not ordinary Javacript - it is React's **JSX**.
- JSX allows you to write your interface code in an HTML-like way that is familiar to most web and app developers
- React automatically replaces JSX with the equivalent Javascript code to create these interface elements.

```javascript
function Foo() {
    return (
        <p>Doesn't this look a lot like HTML code in your Javascript?!</p>
    )
}
```
---

template: components
name: components-4

## Multi-element components
Components can contain multiple user interface elements.
- However, all components must have one 'root' element that encompasses all other sub-elements.
- Note the parentheses around the expression that is being returned - this is necessary.
```javascript
function Hello(){
        return (
                <div>
                    <h1>React Component</h1>
                    <p>Hello world!</p>
                </div>
        )
}
```

[Try it!](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/dmeovLta/5/)

---

template: components
name: components-5

## Components are not exactly HTML
While JSX components look almost identical to HTML code, they are not HTML and have some slightly different behavior.

To add a class to an HTML element, you use the `class` attribute.
```html
<p class="my_favorite_paragraphs">Ipsum dolor sit amet lorem.</p>
```

To have React render that same HTML, you would have to use the `className` attribute in JSX (unlike HTML, all attributes in JSX have upper-camel case names):
```html
<p className="my_favorite_paragraphs">Ipsum dolor sit amet lorem.</p>
```

This is because `class` is a reserved word in Javascript, and JSX code is placed within Javascript code, after all.

---

template: components
name: components-6

## Components are not exactly HTML (continued)
Attributes in HTML typically have quotes around their values.
```html
<p class="my_favorite_paragraphs">Ipsum dolor sit amet lorem.</p>
```

If inserting a variable or other expression as the value for an attribute in JSX, you cannot surround the variable name in quotes.
```html
<p className={someVariable}>Ipsum dolor sit amet lorem.</p>
```

[Read more](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html#specifying-attributes-with-jsx)

---

template: components
name: components-7

## Components are not exactly HTML (continued again)
HTML allows CSS styles to be written inline in an HTML element in a special `style` attribute:
```html
<p style="color: blue; background-color: pink;">Ipsum dolor sit amet lorem.</p>
```

JSX requires a Javascript object to be passed as the `style` attribute value.
```javascript
const pStyle = {
    color: 'blue',
    backgroundColor: pink; // notice the camelCase style property names - this is Javascript, not CSS!
}
```
And inserted into the JSX without quotes around it.
```html
<p style={pStyle}>Ipsum dolor sit amet lorem.</p>
```

---

template: components
name: components-8

## Styling components
- React developers are encouraged to use **one external CSS file for every one React component file**.
- Inline styles, whether in React JSX or in plain HTML, are considered **a bad practice** - don't use them!
- For example a component named `Article.js` should have a corresponding CSS file named `Article.css`
- The component file then imports the CSS file using Javascript import syntax.

```javascript
import './Article.css';
```

---

template: components
name: components-9

## Styling components (continued)
CSS files used by React should select for React components by their className.

For example, given the following JSX:
```html
<div className="intro">
        <h1 className="intro-heading">React Component</h1>
        <p className="intro-paragraph">Hello world!</p>
</div>
```

The CSS file would target specific components using CSS class syntax, irrespective of which type of HTML element the component is ultimately generated as.
```css
.intro { 
    border: 1px solid red; 
    padding: 20px;
}
.intro-heading {
    font-weight: normal;
    font-size: 30px;
    font-family: georgia;
}
.intro-paragraph {
    color: #505050;
    font-family: helvetica;
}

```

# Props

template: props
name: props-1

## Accepting arguments
Props are arguments passed to a component that can influence its content or behavior.

This custom `Article` component accepts a props object as its argument and inserts some of the values therein into the JSX content:
```javascript
function Article(props) {
    return (
        <article>
            <h1>{props.heading}</h1>
            <p>{props.paragraph</p>
        </article>
    )
}
```

---

template: props
name: props-2

## Passing props
This custom `Section` component includes two `Article` components nested within it and passes each of them different values to be placed automatically into the `props` parameters of each.
```javascript
function Section() {
    return (
        <section>
            <Article heading="Puppies for Sale" paragraph="Get 'em while they last!'" />
            <Article heading="Free Kittens" paragraph="Anytime, anywhere!'" />
        </section>
    )
}
```

[Try it!](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/1j4udLtk/39/)

---

template: props
name: props-3

## Functions as arguments
Javascript, of course, can accept function definitions as arguments.  For example, this component will run any function passed as an argument named `action` whenever the user clicks the paragraph:
```javascript
function Card(props) {
	return (
  	<div>
  	  <p onClick={props.action}>Click me!</p>
  	</div>
  )
}
```

We could easily pass the definition of the function from any component that includes an instaance of `Card` within it:
```javascript
<Card action={ () => { alert("See what I mean? Javascript is fun!") } } />
<Card action={ () => { fetch('https://my.api.mockaroo.com/users.json?key=d9ddfc40') } } />
```

name: props-3

## Summary
Props are a jargon word for arguments passed to a function.
- when using JSX to include a component, arguments are passed to the component as JSX attributes, e.g. `<Article heading="Free Kittens" />`
- any type of value can be passed as an argument to a component within the props object: a string, number, function definition, object, array, etc.
