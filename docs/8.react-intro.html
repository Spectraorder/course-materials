# Overview

## React concept
React.js is a tool for auto-generating HTML, CSS, and browser-based Javascript for web app client interfaces.
- created and maintained by Facebook
- built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) - a popular Javascript runtime environment most often used for back-end app development.
- React.js scripts are written in Javascript with the addition of [React's unique JSX syntax](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html)

## Choice of approach
- HTML & CSS are *quite simple* languages for indicating the content and style of web pages, respectively.
- Javascript is a *quite complex* language with many unusual but interesting features.
- You may wonder why anyone would desire to exhange code written in such simple languages with code written in a highly complex language.

## React.js is neither front- nor back-end

React.js programs themselves are not web apps - they comprise neither the front nor the back end.
- React.js programs are run in order to generate client-side (i.e. front-end) HTML, CSS, and browser-based Javascript code.
- These generated codes together comprise the front-end of an application.

# A Word About HTML & CSS

---

template: html-css
name: html-css-1

## Concept
Any web app browser understands three core web technologies:
- **Hypertext Markup Language** (HTML) - controls the content present on the web page
- **Cascading Style Sheets** (CSS) - controls the visual style of the content on the web page
- **Javascript** (JS) - controls the iteractive behavior of the web page (how does the page change when a user clicks, types, moves them mouse, etc)

---

## Javascript
In addition to controlling the interactive behaviors of web pages running in web browsers, Javascript has found new life in other environments:
- writing Javascript to autogenerate HTML and CSS for a web app by using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- web [browser extensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension) written in Javascript
- scripts to automate processes in [Adobe Creative Suite](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/scripting.html)
- interactive music and video composition with Cycling 74's [Max/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/)
- server-side programming with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
- database queries in [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongo/#bin.mongo), [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/js/), and others
- [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) is designed to be a Javascript-like language that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.

## HTML in three slides (slide 1)
For any given web page, HTML code indicates the type of content to show as well as each piece of content's purpose, or semantic meaning.
- A level 1 heading: `<h1>Puppies For Sale</h1>`
- A paragraph: `<p>Buy now while supplies last!</p>`
- An image of a lonely puppy: `<img src="images/lonely_puppy.jpg" />`
- An article with a level 1 heading, an image of a sad puppy, and a paragraph with a link to another web page - [try it](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/erq4hzya/2/): 
```html
<article>
        <h1>Puppies For Sale</h1>
        <img src="images/lonely_puppy.jpg" />
        <p>
            Buy now while supplies last!
            <a href="puppies.html">Learn more</a>
        </p>
</article>
```

## HTML in three slides (slide 2)
Many web sites see the same basic content structures repeated across multiple pages, or repeated within a single page.  [Try it](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/adgrp9zb/5/)
```html
<section>
    <!-- the first article -->
    <article>
        <h1>Puppies For Sale</h1>
        <img src="images/lonely_puppy.jpg" />
        <p>
            Buy now while supplies last!
            <a href="puppies.html">Learn more</a>
        </p>
    </article>
    <!-- the second article... notice its structural similarity to the first -->
    <article>
        <h1>Kittens For Sale</h1>
        <img src="images/sad_kitten.jpg" />
        <p>
            Get 'em while they're hot!
            <a href="kittens.html">Learn more</a>
        </p>
    </article>
</section>
```

## HTML in three slides (slide 3)
Actually, we're more-or-less finished explaining HTML in 2 slides. 

What you just learned is how content that will be displayed in the `body` of a web page is represented in HTML code.
- Learn [a bit more about other necessary parts of an HTML document](https://nyu-computer-science.github.io/web-design/html/).

## CSS in three slides (slide 1)
For any given web page, CSS code indicates the style to use for the content indicated by the HTML.
- Give *all* level 2 headings green text: `h2 { color: green; }`
- Give *all* paragraphs a pink background: `p { background-color: pink; }`
- Set the dimensions of *all* images: `img { width: 200px; height: 300px; }`
- Give *all* articles a thick pink dotted border, a bold `serif` font, and lots of space around the contents inside them - [try it](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/adgrp9zb/6/): 
```css
article {
    border: 10px dotted pink;
    font-family: georgia;
    font-weight: bold;
    padding: 20px;
}
```

## CSS in three slides (slide 2)
Let's say you had four paragraphs, and wanted to style only two of them the same.  Mark them with a `class` attribute in the HTML.  If you want to uniquely style only one, mark it with an `id` attribute:
```html
<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
<p class="my_favorite_paragraphs">Ipsum dolor sit amet lorem.</p>
<p id="a_really_special_paragraph">Dolor sit amet lorem ipsum.</p>
<p class="my_favorite_paragraphs">Ipsum dolor sit amet lorem.</p>
```

And select only the paragraphs that match these attributes in the CSS - [try it](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/adgrp9zb/8/):
```css
p.my_favorite_paragraphs {
    box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px; /* a drop shadow */
}
p#a_really_special_paragraph {
    font-size: 24px; /* relatively big */
}
```

## CSS in three slides (slide 3)
That's almost it.  But there is one very important part of CSS code that we will not address here is how you place elements onto the web page in the location where you want them to go.

There are a variety of ways... the latest greatest is to use so-called CSS Flexbox - see [a simple example](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/adgrp9zb/13/) - this also is what React uses.
- First learn [more about basic CSS](https://nyu-computer-science.github.io/web-design/css/).
- Then learn [more about layouts with CSS flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox).

## Auto-generating HTML & CSS
Now that you have a mastery of HTML & CSS (!), you will use React.js to autogenerate them for you.
- React allows you to easily write reusable templates called components.
- For example, you can define a template for an article with a heading, photo, and paragraph, and then reuse that template across many pages or in many places within one page.

# Components

template: components
name: components-1

## Concept

A component is a modular, reusable user interface element.
- Javascript to define a components can be written in one of two ways: as a class, or as a function

---

template: components
name: components-1

## Component classes
Defining a component with a Javascript class is the most common way, because it was the original way React designed them.

Here is a component class named `Hello` that represents a paragraph of text.

```javascript
class Hello extends Component{
    render(){
        return <p>Hello world!</p>
    }
}
```

---

template: components
name: components-2

## Component functions
Defining a component as a function simplifies the code a bit.

Here is a component function named `Hello` that represents a paragraph of text.

```javascript
function Hello(){
    return <p>Hello world!</p>
}
```

[Try it!](https://jsfiddle.net/barsteinfoo/dmeovLta/1/)

And if you know arrow functions, it can also be written this way:
```javascript
const Hello = () => <p>Hello world!</p>;
```

---

template: components
name: components-3

Components can contain multiple user interface elements.
- All components must have one 'root' element that encompases all other sub-elements.

For example, a `div` is a generic container element that is often used to surround multiple sub-elements.
```javascript
function Hello(){
    return (
    	<div>
            <h1>React Component</h1>
            <p>Hello world!</p>
    	</div>
    )
}
```

Now you have some understanding of using React to generate HTML, CSS, and Javascript for a client-side web pages.
- Thank you.  Bye.
