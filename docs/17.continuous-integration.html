# Overview

--

## Concept

As developers work on a project, they make changes.

--

- Every time a change is made, there is a risk of bugs being introduced.

--

- In order to discover bugs, the software must be periodically built and tested.

--

- **Continous Integration (CI)** is the automated process of building and testing software everytime a component of the system changes.

---

## Benefits

Automated Continuous Integration has several benefits:

--

- uncover bugs more quickly through frequent builds, tests, and notifications

--

- improve quality

--

- reduce time to validate builds

--

- reduce human labor costs

---

name: ci-workflow

# Typical Workflow

--

## Version Control

When a developer makes changes to a system, they typically check those changes into a version control system.

--

- A continuous integration server will be notified whenever a new change has been made.

--

- This notification can arrive either by continually polling the version control logs looking for changes, or by receiving an API call (i.e. a hook) from the version control system when a change is made.

---

template: ci-workflow

## Build System

Once a change to the version control repository has been detected, the Continous Integration server will automatically trigger a new build to begin in order to be able to test the system once the build is done.

--

- Build Systems typically remove any artefacts from previous builds, and assemble the system from scratch.

--

- Builds can occur on a developer's local machine, on a build server, or even on the target production server.

--

- In a Continuous Integration pipeline, once the build is done, the testing framework begins running automated tests.

---

template: ci-workflow

## Testing Framework

Once a fresh build is complete, the testing framework will run automated tests on the system.

--

- Unit Tests, Integration Tests, System Tests, and any other tests that support automation can all be executed.

--

- Once testing is complete, developers are notified of the success or failure of all tests.

---

template: ci-workflow

## Notifications

Developers are notified, immediately upon completion of the build and test phases, whether each of the steps succeeded or failed.

--

With most Continuous Integration tools, notifications can be sent via

--

- email

--

- SMS

--

- Slack messages

--

- notification apps

--

- calls to any arbitrary API endpoint for custom notifications or follow-up automated steps

---

## Badges

In popular project management tools such as GitHub, badges automatically posted to a repository's README.md can indicate the last known success or failure of the build and tests for all to see.

# Best Practices

--

## Commit small changes

Committing small changes to version control limits the scope of what has changed so failures in building or testing are more quickly identified and remedied.

---

template: best-practices

## You break it, you fix it!

If a given developer has broken the build, it is their responsibility to fix it.

--

- Developers are often expected to be _always on call_ to fix broken builds...

--

- ... or whatever else a manager thinks is important.

---

template: best-practices

## Test the right stuff

It's common to miss obvious bugs because automated unit and integration tests have poor code coverage or test the wrong things.

---

template: best-practices

## What to produce

Plan on producing a status, a log, and an artefact.

--

- the **status** is the result, whether the build succeeded or failed

--

- the **log** contains a list of the steps that were completed in the build, and the results of all tests

--

- the **artifact** is the resultant system, which can be uploaded to a server and tagged with an automatically incrementing build number

---

# Travis CI

--

## Hosted continuous integration service

Travis CI is a proprietary hosted continuous integration web service with an especially attractive offer of free usage for open source GitHub repositories.

---

template: travis-ci

## Virtual build servers

When a change is detected in version control, Travis boots up a new virtual server.

--

- Travis clones the version control repository into the virtual machine, and performs the build and test.

---

template: travis-ci

## Key features

Travis comes with the common features of any continuous integration server.

--

- hosted continuous integration solution

--

- free for open source projects

--

- at its simplest, requires the addition of a configuration file to a repository

--

- supports building and testing of many programming languages

--

- integrates with other popular DevOps tools and practices

---

template: travis-ci

## Basic configuration

Travis CI's build and test configuration is written in YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) and saved into a file named `.travis.yml` in the main directory of your project.

--

Node.js example:

```yaml
language: node_js
node_js:
  - "node"
  - "12"
```

--

Python example:

```yaml
language: python
python:
  - "3.4"
  - "3.5"
```

---

template: travis-ci

## More configuration

In addition to basic configuration, Travis supports more detailed instructions and can run arbitrary code at various lifecycle points in the build.

--

```yaml
language: python
python:
  - "3.4"
  - "3.5"
# command to install dependencies
install:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
# command to run tests
script:
  - pytest
# execute a bash script that deploys the app
deploy:
  provider: script
  script: bash scripts/deploy.sh
  on:
    branch: master
```

---

template: travis-ci

## GitHub integration

To link Travis CI to a GitHub repository, such that it detects changes to the repository and triggers continuous integration builds and testing, go to [travis-ci.com](https://travis-ci.com).

--

- Follow the instructions there to link to a GitHub repository. You will be asked to authorize the app on GitHub, and then can modify settings within the travis web app. The setup is relatively straightforward.

--

- As a best practice, have Travis CI _perform automated builds on pull requests_. This allows the pull request reviewer to be sure the code builds and passes automated tests prior to merging the code.

---

template: travis-ci

## Slack integration

Travis CI can send notifications to Slack indicating the results of the latest build.

--

- To do so, the Travis CI app must be authorized for the given Slack workspace - this can be done by your instructor.

--

- Posting build results to Slack with every commit or pull request to every project will quickly eat up message limits for workspaces with Slack's free-tier pricing.

--

- So your instructor may, unfortunately, be reluctant to allow this.

---

template: travis-ci

## Badges

You can embed build status badges that Travis will use to automatically _show the latest status of your build_ into your README.md.

--

The URLs for status images are shown on your Travis CI Repository page:

--

1. Click the status image in the top right to open a dialog box containing common templates for the status image URL in Markdown, HTML, etc.

--

2. Copy the Markdown and paste it into the README.md. Commit this change to GitHub.

# Software as a Service

--

## Automation pipelines

Continuous Integration (CI), followed by Continuous Deployment (CD) goes hand-in-hand with **Software as a Service** (SaaS).

--

- SaaS systems are deployed not to the customers' local machines, but to the software distributor's own servers.

--

- Doing so allows the software distributor to maintain control and ownership of software at all times while granting access to the software to customers / end-users, rather than actually deploying software on customers' own machines.
