We learn how to build software following contemporary best practices.

## Agile development
We will learn **agile development**'s origins.

--

- In particular, we will follow the **Scrum framework** for agile development.

---

template: topics

## Javascript stack
We will dive head-first into the **Javascript stack** for web app development.  In particular, the **MERN stack**.

--

- React.js for the **front-end**

--

- Node.js with Express.js for the **back-end**.

--

- MongoDB as the **database**

--

- Of course, you'll have to absorb HTML, CSS, and Javascript through **osmosis**.

---

template: topics

## We will learn through osmosis?
Yes.

--

- This is perhaps the biggest topic of the course... how to learn for yourself.

---

## Skills we will develop
You cannot do contemporary work with some fundamental skills.

--

- Basic UNIX/Linux commands

--

- Version control (i.e. `git`)

--

- Automating the boring parts (i.e. ssh, unit testing, continuous integration, continuous delivery, continuous deployment)

---

## Questions we will answer
There are common questions we will aim to answer:

--

- What is The World Wide Web?

--

- How do you do *xyz*?

--

- I have an idea for an app... is it hard to do?

--

- Should I go to a start-up academy, or just study at NYU CS?

--

- My internship requires me to know *express-validator*.... what is that?

--

- My friend is making mad money at a start-up using MongoDB... can I learn that?
